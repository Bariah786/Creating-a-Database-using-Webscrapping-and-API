# WebScraping
This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, where I used Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract and clean data from websites. I focused on scraping useful information like city population and details from Wikipedia pages, while applying techniques for data cleaning and regex for pattern matching.
